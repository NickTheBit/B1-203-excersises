\section{Decision tree} 
Split the houses in two sets, one training set and one test set. Then the price labels were either set to 0 or 1 depending on if its price value was below or above the mean respectively. The training set and the binarized target set was used to fit the classification tree. Finally the training set was classified and the accuracy of the classification was calculated.

\subsection{Classification Results}
\begin{verbatim}
Tree Depth: None, Training Accuracy: 1.0000, Test Accuracy: 0.8365
Tree Depth: 3, Training Accuracy: 0.7938, Test Accuracy: 0.7897
Tree Depth: 5, Training Accuracy: 0.8302, Test Accuracy: 0.8227
Tree Depth: 10, Training Accuracy: 0.9095, Test Accuracy: 0.8442
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Regression Results}
\begin{verbatim}
Tree Depth: None, Training MSE: 0.0000, Test MSE: 0.4952
Tree Depth: 3, Training MSE: 0.6177, Test MSE: 0.6424
Tree Depth: 5, Training MSE: 0.4843, Test MSE: 0.5245
Tree Depth: 10, Training MSE: 0.2209, Test MSE: 0.4155
\end{verbatim}

\section {Environment reproduction}
To reproduce the environment used to build the excersise, follow these instructions:

\begin{verbatim}
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/acivate
pip3 install numpy scikit matplotlib
\end{verbatim}

After the above steps the program can be executed by typing

\begin{verbatim}
python3 `ProgramName.py'
\end{verbatim}
